# BLOCK CALCULATOR

## Overview

This program calculates the number of blocks that can be made from a given number of bags of cement, depending on the size of the block. Additionally, it calculates the quantity of quarry dust required based on a mix ratio of 1 part cement to 6 parts quarry dust. The calculations are based on block sizes commonly used in construction.

### Features:

- Calculates the total number of blocks that can be produced from a specified number of bags of cement.
- Calculates the amount of quarry dust required using a 1:6 cement to quarry dust ratio.
- Handles different block sizes with pre-defined values for blocks per bag of cement.

## Usage:

- Enter the number of cement bags in the provided input field.
- Select the block size from the dropdown list (4x16x9, 5x16x9, or 6x16x9).
- Click the "Calculate" button to get the results.
- The output will show the total number of blocks that can be made and the amount of quarry dust required.

## Example of manual Calculation

#### Step 1: Determine the Number of Bags of Cement Needed

#### Total Amount of Quarry Dust:

You have 20 tons of quarry dust.

#### Cement to Quarry Dust Ratio:

For a 1:6 ratio, for every 1 part of cement, there are 6 parts of quarry dust. Therefore, the total parts are 1 + 6 = 7 parts.

#### Total Weight of Quarry Dust:

20 tons = 20,000 kg.

#### Calculate the Weight of Cement Needed:

Cement=20,000kg/6 = 3,333.33kg

#### Convert Cement Weight to Bags:

Number of Bags = 3,333.33kg/50kg per bag = 66.67 (67) bags
